# Party-Invitation-Graphical-Algorithm

A Lady wants to host a party and to determine whom
to be invited. She has n persons to choose from, and she has made up a list
for the pairs of these n persons knowing each other (i.e. not necessarily all
know each other). She wants to invite as many as possible persons, subject to
the constraints: for each person attending the party (i) at least k << n other
persons who know (ii) at least k persons in the party who do not know.

Here I develop an algorithm which solve the problem effectively.
